I'm createing a TODO list app.

This is a fullstack MERN application with the following feature: - 
- User can create a new account.
- User can login with the existing account.
- User can Create a new item for their TODO list.
- User can Read all the items of the ToDo list.
- User can Update the item.
- User can Delete the item from the list.
- Each user will have their own list.
- No 2 users will be able to see other's TODO list.
- User can logout from the app.
